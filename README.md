# UPI Banking System

This project implements a Unified Payments Interface (UPI) banking system using PHP, allowing users to manage accounts, check balances, and perform fund transfers. The system is designed to be secure, scalable, and compliant with UPI standards.

## Features

### User Management
- **Login**: Users log in using their registered E-mail and password.
- **Signup**: New users can create an account by providing necessary details, including E-mail Id, mobile number and password.
- **Account Creation**: A unique UPI ID is generated for each user to perform transactions.

### Transaction Module
- **Check Balance**: Users can view their current account balance.
- **Transfer Balance**: Funds can be transferred to other UPI-enabled accounts using the recipient’s UPI ID.

### Payment Gateway
- **UPI API Integration**: Integrated with UPI APIs for secure and seamless transaction processing.

## Technical Requirements

- **PHP**: Version 7.4 or higher
- **Database**: MySQL or any compatible DBMS
- **Dependencies**:
  - PHP libraries for encryption.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend**: PHP-based API for handling user requests, transactions, and database interactions.
- **Database**: Stores user details, transaction history, and balances.

## Security Measures

- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data (passwords, transaction details).
- **Authentication**: Mobile number and password combination for user authentication.
- **Authorization**: Access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized actions.

## Testing and Deployment

- **Unit Testing**: PHPUnit or similar frameworks used for component testing.
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing for smooth interaction between system components.
- **Deployment**: Deployable on Apache, Nginx, or any suitable web server with a compatible database.
